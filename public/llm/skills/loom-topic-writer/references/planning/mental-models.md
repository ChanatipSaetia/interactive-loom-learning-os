## Start Here: Mental Model and Section Selection

Use this table as the agent's table of contents before planning or writing a topic. Identify what the learner should be able to define, picture, compare, explain or do; then select the section that teaches that mental model. Each row names a supported section type to request from the authoring guide. Read its exact component signatures before writing.

Learning-first, representation-aware authoring: learning objective → knowledge structure → learner action → candidate section capabilities → representation and configuration → focused contracts → OUI and narration → validation/repair → delivery. Choose the simplest representation or complementary combination that fully supports the intended learning experience. Native Loom sections and OpenUI are first-class choices; there is no section ranking, visual quota or mandatory sequence.

Compare candidates by knowledge fidelity (preserve information and relationships), learner action (what the learner does), perspective coverage (what additional views reveal), cognitive clarity (avoid unnecessary complexity), assessment suitability (what response demonstrates the outcome) and authoring feasibility (what the evidence can actually model). Record the choice in TopicPlan activity, rationale and presentation.strategy before retrieving exact signatures. Resolve relevant advisory warnings or explicitly justify proceeding; structural validity alone is not experience readiness.

Bullets teach numbered linear procedures, checklists, prerequisites, key points, supporting details and concise summaries. The knowledge itself should fit a list; moving paragraphs into bullet items is not a representation decision. Compare OpenUI compositions proactively: matched attributes in a table, verified use-case examples in cards, spatial mechanisms in labelled Svg, and measured quantities in charts. Simplest means clearest for the learner, not fewest component types or easiest syntax. OpenUI Steps add visual stage guidance; Flowchart teaches interactions, responsibilities, messages, data or states, even in a linear process when perspectives add understanding. Reflection Sequence practises order; User Journey follows a person's experience. Text is appropriate for connected prose, nuanced explanation and argument; consider alternatives when they clarify the objective, without forcing interactivity.

Flashcards introduce definitions and meanings as well as practise recall. OpenUI cards/stacks compare examples, tables compare factual attributes, labelled Svg diagrams explain spatial structure, and charts explain quantities or trends. Empirical charts require supplied or verified data; clearly label illustrative data and never invent benchmark results. Tradeoff Sandbox evaluates options and decisions; Formula Sandbox explores parameter sensitivity. Select the other native sections by their learning purpose below.

For a 3D web research lesson, compare matched capabilities in an OpenUI table, inspect annotated use-case cards, and explain camera/geometry with a labelled Svg when each serves an objective. Bullets can guide real initialization steps; native Flowchart can trace system messages. These are candidates, not a required section mix.

For full lessons, combine sections only when each adds a distinct contribution: e.g. Flowchart explains RAG tool execution, Bullets guides implementation, Scenario explores retrieval failures and Quiz assesses application. Distinguish presentation, exploration and assessment. Viewing, clicking, switching views and flipping cards are engagement, not demonstrated mastery.

Retrieve selected section rules, then library-scoped component contracts and dependencies. If focused retrieval fails, retry with the correct library and forceRefresh; then use the selected legacy section guide (omit library/components). For OpenUI, retrieve its section guide and selected component families. If contracts remain unavailable, report the blocker and revise/revalidate the plan only to an equally faithful supported representation; never silently downgrade to Text/Bullets or invent signatures. Focused OpenUI contracts include compact section rules and beats: request only the actual composition components and required model types; permitted generic child alternatives are not all dependencies.

| Mental model / learning goal | Section type | Learner question and selection cue |
|---|---|---|
| Orientation, purpose and roadmap | `intro` | What will I learn, why does it matter, and where are we going? |
| Definitions, meaning, vocabulary and recall | `flashcards` | What does this term or concept mean? Teach its meaning on the back of a card, then use it for recall; flashcards introduce concepts as well as practise them. |
| Connected explanation and narrative | `text` | Does this idea need connected prose or narrative? Before choosing Text, consider native sections and OpenUI comparisons, diagrams, tables or charts; use prose when it best teaches the goal. |
| Linear procedures, prerequisites, checklists and key points | `bullets` | Is the task a linear procedure, checklist, key points or summary? Preserve comparative, spatial and relational structure when a table or diagram teaches it better. |
| Visual recognition and concrete references | `image-gallery` | What does it look like? Compare examples, textures, objects or screenshots. |
| Classification and distinctions | `taxonomy-browser` | What kinds exist, what defines them, and how do I recognise their differences? |
| Relationships between concepts | `concept-map` | How do ideas connect, depend on, support or differ from each other? Label the relationship explicitly. |
| Layered dependency and foundation | `pillar-layer` | What builds on or is supported by what? Examples include network layers or cloud foundation → agent runtime → application. |
| Process, responsibility and interaction | `flowchart` | What happens, what triggers it, who handles it, and how do participants interact? Choose the view from the table below. |
| A person’s experience with a product or service | `user-journey` | What does the person want, do and experience at each stage, and how can friction be resolved? |
| Measured time, duration, overlap and waiting | `timeline` | When does each task start and finish, what runs together, and what must wait? |
| Parts of a measurable whole and conditional probability | `breakdown-tree` | How does a total divide through a hierarchy? Use quantity mode for costs/counts and probability mode for conditional branches and path probabilities. |
| Presenting options, comparing alternatives and trade-offs | `tradeoff-sandbox` | What are my options, how do they compare, and when should I choose each? Show strengths, limitations, gains, costs and suitability; a recommendation can explain why an option fits. Use this for option comparison even without formal mathematical optimisation. |
| Input–output relationships and sensitivity | `formula-sandbox` | How does changing an input change a calculated result? Let the learner vary inputs to an authored formula. |
| Rule-based diagnosis and selection | `decision-tree` | Which option fits my situation after answering a sequence of questions? |
| Consequences across decisions | `scenario` | What happens if I choose this, then make another decision? Explore authored paths and outcomes. |
| Checking understanding and applying knowledge | `quiz` | Can I answer or apply what has already been taught? |
| Reconstructing order and procedure | `reflection-sequence` | Can I arrange the supplied steps into the correct sequence? |
| Structured reasoning and explanation | `reflection-template` | Can I complete a sound explanation using the supplied concepts and sentence blanks? |
| Factual comparisons, visual examples, spatial diagrams and data | `openui` | Would a chart, table, simple procedure, drawing, analogy or mixed composition express this idea best? See the visual choices below. |

### Choosing views within a Flowchart

Choose one meaningful primary view with Flowchart.initialView. In presentation.strategy record that view, the guided Journey/JourneyStep path and any purposeful NarrationStep.view transitions. Multiple narration steps can use the same beat to reveal different perspectives. Do not require all six views or invent actors, interactions, event data or states to enable them. Use Branch/BranchOption only for real alternatives, async for fire-and-forget commands, sendsTo for declared messages, Event.data for meaningful payloads, and StateMachine plus Event.enters for genuine lifecycle transitions. Sequence spacing is not measured duration. A linear process can still justify several perspectives when each teaches something distinct.

| View | Mental model it teaches |
|---|---|
| event-storming | Event → policy → command → system → resulting event; explain triggers and rules. |
| architecture | Components, their responsibilities and their connections. |
| swimlanes | Ownership and handoffs between participants. |
| sequence | Who sends what to whom, and in what order; vertical spacing is not measured duration. |
| data-flow | What information moves between components. |
| state-machine | How events change the state of something. |

### Choosing an OpenUI visual

| Mental model / learning goal | Visual |
|---|---|
| Compare concrete examples or evidence layouts side by side | Card / Stack with concise explanations or labelled Svg drawings |
| Compare amounts or rank categories | BarChart / HorizontalBarChart |
| Follow a measurement over time | LineChart |
| Show an amount developing over time | AreaChart; use cumulative data when teaching accumulation |
| Show flat shares of one whole | PieChart / donut variant / SingleStackedBarChart |
| Compare used and remaining capacity | Stacked HorizontalBarChart |
| Examine two numeric variables | ScatterChart; an association alone does not establish causation |
| Compare profiles across comparable criteria | RadarChart |
| Look up or compare factual attributes | Table |
| Explain spatial structure, anatomy, a mechanism or a concrete analogy | Labelled Svg drawing |
| Explain a straightforward procedure | Steps |

### Applying the selection

- Flashcards can define and introduce a concept before the learner has memorised it. Put the term or question on the front and a concise meaning on the back; use examples or dialogue when helpful. They are a teaching format as well as a recall activity. Use Text or OpenUI when a longer connected explanation is needed.
- Tradeoff Sandbox also presents choices and compares alternatives. Choose it when the learner needs to evaluate options, their strengths and weaknesses, or suitability for a situation. A simple factual lookup matrix can use an OpenUI Table; input-driven calculations belong in Formula Sandbox.
- Keep the distinctions explicit: Taxonomy classifies; Breakdown Tree divides a measurable whole. Pillar Layer shows foundations; Flowchart shows process. Sequence shows interaction order; Timeline shows measured time. Decision Tree selects by rules; Scenario explores consequences.
- Select only the sections that help this topic. This is a catalogue of teaching choices, not a mandatory lesson sequence or a requirement to include every type. A focused explanation may use one strong section; a fuller topic can introduce meanings, show relationships or a mechanism, compare options, then practise applying the idea.
- Read and Present deliver the same mental model. Read supports inspection and learner interaction; Present guides attention with narration and focus. Use each section's documented beats and view controls. In Present, quiz and reflection answers can be demonstrated by the stage; they are learner practice in the interactive Read mode.
