# US-13: Sequence Diagram View Projection

## What to build

Implement a new `SEQUENCE` view projection layout inside the flowchart SVG. 

It parses column slots (`col`) to draw vertical dashed lifeline paths down the canvas with component title boxes at the top and bottom. It parses relations where the views include `SEQUENCE` to render horizontal network request/response arrows at the corresponding row slots (`row`), displaying the custom `rel.label` text directly on/above the connection lines.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Sequence lifelines render as vertical dashed lines down the columns defined in views.SEQUENCE
- [ ] Component cards/headings are drawn at the top and bottom of each lifeline
- [ ] Horizontal request/response arrows are drawn showing message calls between lifelines at their respective row positions
- [ ] Message arrows display the custom label parameter (e.g., method name or protocol)
- [ ] Renders activation bars (thick vertical rectangles) on the lifelines during active steps
- [ ] Integrates into the 2x2 grid dropdown selectors

## Unified Diagram Mapping & Relationships

Every system topic compiles a master event-driven schema (Event Storming) into several other derived diagram views. 

### Diagram View Purposes
* **Event Storming (High-Level Domain Flow)**: Maps the logical business rules, triggers, and state boundaries chronologically across the entire domain.
* **Activity Swimlanes (High-Level Control Flow)**: Shows the operational handoffs and ownership of execution steps across different actors and system boundaries.
* **System Architecture (Low-Level Topology)**: Illustrates the structural deployment topology, network boundaries, and communication protocols of physical services.
* **Sequence Diagram (Low-Level Execution Timeline)**: Tracks the precise, time-based back-and-forth network requests and responses between components.
* **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: Follows the transformation of data payloads and state schemas as they are processed through the system pipeline.
* **State Machine**: Models the internal lifecycle statuses and transition loops of the core Aggregate components (e.g. Orchestrator, Document Job, Order).
* **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Details the database table structures, columns, and relations that store the state of the Aggregates.
