## Focused component contracts

Page rules: root = Page("Title", body, heading?). One section file is one authored page; choose components, not a section type or library. Use one main visual/activity plus supporting text. Local controls and their visual form one activity. Multiple competing activities produce review warnings, not a component-count rejection. Size the topic to the learner goal. Generic children are alternatives, not mandatory dependencies. Use exact positional signatures; request actual child components and required data models. TextContent handles Markdown prose; Text is a short line or metric. Choose ImageGallery for a preview grid or LearningGallery for captioned learning scenes. All components share one catalog; prebuilt activities are reusable compositions, not a separate authoring mode. Query/Mutation host tools are deferred. Local reactive $variables, input bindings and Set/Reset actions are allowed. Do not use actions unsupported by the host. Include useful learner-visible reference links for deeper reading, with descriptive labels and supplied or checked destinations; keep the core lesson self-contained. See contracts/learner-references.md (installed skills: references/core/learner-references.md). Before adding image sources, read contracts/images.md and runtime.md (installed skills: references/core/images.md); a reachable HTTPS URL may still be blocked by the MCP host. Use supplied/verified chart data or label illustrative values; never invent benchmarks. Present is hands-free, may use internal scenes/beats, and may render differently from Read using the same content. Demonstrations use authored defaults and never count as learner attempts. Narration is authored in OUI; preserve statement IDs and validate beat/target references. Preview narrow and desktop Read/Present layouts.

## Component Signatures

VisualCardItem(body: BoldText, id?: string, bgImageSrc?: string, tag?: Tag, bgImageAlt?: string) — A single photo-first card inside a VisualCardBlock: a BoldText body panel, an optional Tag, and a background image (bgImageSrc must be a real URL; bgImageAlt is its alt text).
BoldText(variant?: "text" | "number", value: string, subtext?: string, subtextVariant?: "text" | "number" | "metric", size?: "xs" | "sm" | "md" | "lg") — Emphasized (bold) text line with optional subtext. variant 'number' uses tabular number styling; subtextVariant 'metric' colors a leading +/- subtext green/red.
Tag(text: string, icon?: Icon, size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg", variant?: "neutral" | "info" | "success" | "warning" | "danger") — Styled tag/badge with optional Icon and variant
Icon(name: string, category?: string) — A lucide icon by kebab-case name (e.g. 'circle-check'). Optional category picks a topical fallback when the name doesn't resolve.

### VisualCardItem: teaching purpose

- Introduce: Organize related explanations, examples, labels or supplied metrics into a coherent learning page.
- Explore: Inspect meaningful groups, matched examples and supporting detail while preserving the main activity’s focus.
- Evidence: Layout, decoration and displayed metrics do not independently establish learner understanding.
- Limits: Structure should clarify the information rather than add novelty. Preserve the component’s exact fields, keep dense content readable, and do not invent quantities merely to populate a metric or card.

## Narration Files

Present is hands-free. Use root = Narration([NarrationStep(beat, caption, effects)]). Effects: Highlight, NarrationCallout, Spotlight. Keep Read and Present content shared and state separate.
