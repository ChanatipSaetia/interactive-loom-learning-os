## Focused component contracts

Page rules: root = Page("Title", body, heading?). One section file is one authored page; choose components, not a section type or library. Use one main visual/activity plus supporting text. Local controls and their visual form one activity. Multiple competing activities produce review warnings, not a component-count rejection. Size the topic to the learner goal. Generic children are alternatives, not mandatory dependencies. Use exact positional signatures; request actual child components and required data models. TextContent handles Markdown prose; Text is a short line or metric. Choose ImageGallery for a preview grid or LearningGallery for captioned learning scenes. All components share one catalog; prebuilt activities are reusable compositions, not a separate authoring mode. Query/Mutation host tools are deferred. Local reactive $variables, input bindings and Set/Reset actions are allowed. Do not use actions unsupported by the host. Use supplied/verified chart data or label illustrative values; never invent benchmarks. Present is hands-free, may use internal scenes/beats, and may render differently from Read using the same content. Demonstrations use authored defaults and never count as learner attempts. Narration is authored in OUI; preserve statement IDs and validate beat/target references. Preview narrow and desktop Read/Present layouts.

## Component Signatures

System(id: string, title: string, desc: string, kind?: "aggregate" | "service" | "database" | "external", stateMachine?: StateMachine) — A system that handles commands: an "aggregate" (owned domain model) or an "external" service.
  - id: System ID, unique within the flowchart; steps refer to it with `handledBy` / `delegatesTo`.
  - title: System name shown on its sticky (e.g. "Order Service").
  - desc: What the system owns or does.
  - kind: Optional "aggregate" (owned domain model), "service" (owned component without its own domain model), "database" (data store) or "external" (outside system). Default "external".
  - stateMachine: Optional StateMachine(...) for a system that orchestrates the flow.
StateMachine(states: MachineState[], initialState: string) — State machine for an orchestrating system. `initialState` is a state ID.
  - states: The states, as MachineState references.
  - initialState: ID of the starting MachineState.
MachineState(id: string, label: string, color: string) — A state of a system state machine.
  - id: State ID, unique within the state machine.
  - label: State name shown in the state machine view.
  - color: CSS colour for the state, e.g. "var(--ctp-green)" or "#a6d189".

### System: teaching purpose

- Introduce: Define the System content or configuration consumed by its owning component.
- Explore: Inspect it through the owning component and its documented behavior.
- Evidence: A supporting data declaration does not independently provide learning evidence.
- Limits: Use the exact required fields and references. This supporting contract does not imply an independently rendered activity, interaction, grading or persistence.

## Narration Files

Present is hands-free. Use root = Narration([NarrationStep(beat, caption, effects)]). Effects: Highlight, NarrationCallout, Spotlight. Keep Read and Present content shared and state separate.
