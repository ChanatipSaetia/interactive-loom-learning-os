## Focused component contracts

Page rules: root = Page("Title", body, heading?). One section file is one authored page; choose components, not a section type or library. Use one main visual/activity plus supporting text. Local controls and their visual form one activity. Multiple competing activities produce review warnings, not a component-count rejection. Size the topic to the learner goal. Generic children are alternatives, not mandatory dependencies. Use exact positional signatures; request actual child components and required data models. TextContent handles Markdown prose; Text is a short line or metric. Choose ImageGallery for a preview grid or LearningGallery for captioned learning scenes. All components share one catalog; prebuilt activities are reusable compositions, not a separate authoring mode. Query/Mutation host tools are deferred. Local reactive $variables, input bindings and Set/Reset actions are allowed. Do not use actions unsupported by the host. Use supplied/verified chart data or label illustrative values; never invent benchmarks. Present is hands-free, may use internal scenes/beats, and may render differently from Read using the same content. Demonstrations use authored defaults and never count as learner attempts. Narration is authored in OUI; preserve statement IDs and validate beat/target references. Preview narrow and desktop Read/Present layouts.

## Component Signatures

IconText(icon: Icon, iconVariant?: "neutral" | "info" | "success" | "warning" | "danger" | "inverted" | "filled" | "soft", iconSize?: "xs" | "s" | "m" | "l" | "xl" | "sm" | "md" | "lg", title: string, subtitle?: string, bold?: boolean, layout?: "horizontal" | "vertical") — An icon badge with a title and optional subtitle, laid out horizontally or vertically. iconVariant sets the badge color.
Icon(name: string, category?: string) — A lucide icon by kebab-case name (e.g. 'circle-check'). Optional category picks a topical fallback when the name doesn't resolve.

### IconText: teaching purpose

- Introduce: Develop connected explanations, arguments, definitions, qualifications and concise supporting labels.
- Explore: Read examples and follow reasoning with a clear hierarchy; use prose when its connections and nuance serve the goal.
- Evidence: Viewing, opening or selecting is engagement; ask for an observable explanation or application when the objective requires evidence.
- Limits: Keep the selected component’s role: TextContent supports Markdown prose; Text is a short line or metric. Labels and emphasis do not replace a missing mechanism, comparison or assessment.

## Narration Files

Present is hands-free. Use root = Narration([NarrationStep(beat, caption, effects)]). Effects: Highlight, NarrationCallout, Spotlight. Keep Read and Present content shared and state separate.
