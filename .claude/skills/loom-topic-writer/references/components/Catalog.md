## Focused component contracts

Page rules: root = Page("Title", body, heading?). One section file is one authored page; choose components, not a section type or library. Use one main learner action with complementary cards, images, text, charts and reference links where useful; these compose one page, not separate content modes. Proactively include visual examples for visual subjects and visible sources for researched claims. See contracts/media-composition.md (installed skills: references/planning/media-composition.md). Local controls and their visual form one activity. Multiple competing activities produce review warnings, not a component-count rejection. Size the topic to the learner goal. Generic children are alternatives, not mandatory dependencies. Use exact positional signatures; request actual child components and required data models. TextContent handles Markdown prose; Text is a short line or metric. Choose ImageGallery for a preview grid or LearningGallery for captioned learning scenes. All components share one catalog; prebuilt activities are reusable compositions, not a separate authoring mode. Query/Mutation host tools are deferred. Local reactive $variables, input bindings and Set/Reset actions are allowed. Do not use actions unsupported by the host. Include useful learner-visible reference links for deeper reading, with descriptive labels and supplied or checked destinations; keep the core lesson self-contained. See contracts/learner-references.md (installed skills: references/core/learner-references.md). Before adding image sources, read contracts/images.md and runtime.md (installed skills: references/core/images.md); a reachable HTTPS URL may still be blocked by the MCP host. Use supplied/verified chart data or label illustrative values; never invent benchmarks. Present is hands-free, may use internal scenes/beats, and may render differently from Read using the same content. Demonstrations use authored defaults and never count as learner attempts. Narration is authored in OUI; preserve statement IDs and validate beat/target references. Preview narrow and desktop Read/Present layouts.

## Component Signatures

Catalog(topics: TopicRef[]) — Content catalog (root of index.oui): the ordered list of topics.
  - topics: The topics in catalog order, as TopicRef calls.
TopicRef(id: string) — Includes the topic folder <id>/topic.oui in the catalog.
  - id: Topic folder name under the content root.

### Catalog: teaching purpose

- Introduce: Organize authored learning content and its navigation or storage references.
- Explore: Identify the relevant topic or page and follow its declared order and identifiers.
- Evidence: Navigation or source presence is not learning evidence.
- Limits: These are document/navigation contracts, not standalone teaching activities. Follow the exact document role, paths and storage authorization; showing is not saving.

## Narration Files

Present is hands-free. Use root = Narration([NarrationStep(beat, caption, effects)]). Effects: Highlight, NarrationCallout, Spotlight. Keep Read and Present content shared and state separate.
