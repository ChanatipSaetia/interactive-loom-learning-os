## Topic Layout

A topic is a folder named after its topic ID (lowercase letters, digits, `-` and `_`, e.g. `http-caching`):

- `topic.oui`: `root = Topic(...)`, the catalog metadata and the ordered list of `SectionRef("<name>")`.
- `sections/<name>.oui`: one section per file, `root = <Section>(...)` where `<Section>` is a section component (Intro, Text, Bullets, Flowchart, Quiz, …), or a standard OpenUI section (see Standard OpenUI Sections).
- `sections/<name>.narrate.oui`: `root = Narration(...)`, the script the section plays to when the learner plays the topic in Present mode (see Narration Files). One per section; not listed in topic.oui.

Every file is its own openui-lang program: it has its own `root` and its own statement names, so names may repeat across files.
In the rules below, "program" means one file. The `root` of `topic.oui` is `Topic(...)`; the `root` of a section file is a section component.

## Output Formats

Answer in the format the user asks for. If they do not say, use the single .oui file.

1. **Single .oui file** (`<topic-id>.loom.oui`): the first line is `// @loom-topic <topic-id>` (followed by `// @loom-domain <domain-id>` when the topic is kept in one of the learner's domains, the folder `Loom/<domain-id>/` in their drive), then every file of the topic, each after a marker line `// === <path> ===`. Put it in one code block. For several topics, repeat the `// @loom-topic` line before each topic's files.

   ```
   // @loom-topic <topic-id>
   // === topic.oui ===
   root = Topic(...)
   // === sections/intro.oui ===
   root = Intro(...)
   ```

2. **Folder of .oui files**: one code block per file, each preceded by its path (`<topic-id>/topic.oui`, `<topic-id>/sections/<name>.oui`) so the user can save them into that folder.

The user opens the result in Loom Viewer (https://chanatipsaetia.github.io/interactive-loom-learning-os/viewer.html) or imports it into Loom Studio. Outside the code block(s), say nothing or at most one short sentence.
